Design a portfolio site in HTML and CSS given a design mockup as a PDF-file. Make sure the website is responsive. 

This is the design mockup given by Udacity.

This is my result based on the mockup. The first two images show how the website will look on desktop and iPad. The other two images show how it will appear on mobile devices.
